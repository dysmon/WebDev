    <h1>Dedication</h1>
    <p>
      My first gift and my last, to you <br />
      I dedicate this fascicle of songs -<br />
      The only wealth I have:<br />
      Just as they are, to you.<br />
      <br />
      I speak the truth in soberness, and say<br />
      I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes,<br />
      Had rather hear you praise<br />
      This bosomful of songs<br />
    </p>
